**The big short**

**Pricing of a loan**

**Bonds main characteristics**

* **Main components of a bond :**
  * **Maturity :** form a few days (money markets) to may years (ex. 30 year, perpetual bonds exist)
  * **Face value or principal :** amount to be reimbursed when the bond matures
  * **Coupon :** percentage of face value to be paid at each end of period
  * Some stuff I missed

**Price fall, yields rise and the opposite**

**Y = yield, P = price**

**P = C~T~ / (1+y)^T^**

Face value and market price

Face value, price quoted as, market price, the is trading at

If price quoted is the ratio of the face value divide by the price times 100, when ratio is higher than 100 we’re in a premium par, if it’s less we’re in a discount to par

To get back after a 50% loss we need to make a 100% of the amount after loss

Rate of return :

* Keep the bond until it matures
  * Rate of return = yield
* Sell the bond before maturity
  * Rate of return > yield
  * Rate of return = yield
  * Rate of return < yield
* If the yield goes up imagine we have 4% percent but now the bonds is 6%
* Everything is math and expectations

If you click randomly you diversify and if you ignore the information you don’t need to do math

Rate of return example :

* Consider a bond with the following characteristics :
  * Face value : 1000.-: F
  * Coupon 4.375% : C
  * Maturity : 30 years : T
  * Yield of maturity : 4.6% : y
  * Issue price : 96.38% : P0
  * Price after 6 months : 138.05% : P1
  * The bond just paid half a coupon
* And now you just apply to the equation and you check the difference in price and in this example you got a lot of money

Bond indices :

* Aggregate of a big number of bonds with pre-defined characteristics
* Bond indices are used as benchmarks by active-investment managers
  * J.P. Morgan
  * S&P500
  * Barclays

**Exercice :**

* **Face value :** 1000
* **Maturity :** 2 years

**Zero Coupé formula : P = F~T~ / (1 + y)^T^**

**P0 > Ft -> if 1+y < 1 => y < 0**

**German government bond = bund**

**JGB = Japanse government bonds**

**The size of the bonds market is kinda the same as the stock market**

**The total value of the market capitalization was 22% in 1980 and in 2020 it was 110%**

**Market Cap. = Price of stocks * nb of stocks**

**P0 / earnings per share = P/E = 33.8% in the case of Apple**

**We compare the amount of earnings by the price**

**Stocks and the stock market :**

* **Book value :** net worth of the firm according to the balance sheet
* **Market value balance sheet :** financial statement that uses market value of assets and liabilities
* **Liquidation value :** net proceeds that would be realized bz selling the firm’s assets and paying off the creditors

**Earnings per share (EPS) = company’s profit / number of shares**

**Price to earnings ratio (P/E) ratio = price per share / earnings per share = P / EPS**

**Price to book ratio (P/B) = market capitalization / book value** ****

**Valuation by comparables :**

* Identify a sample of similar firms as potential *comparables*
* Examine how much investors in the comparable companies are prepared to pay per dollar of earnings or book assets

**Dow chemicals overvalued about 10%, job of analyste**

**Dividend discount model :** P0 = (Div + P1) / (1 + r)

P = price, Div = dividend price, r = rate of return

R = (Div1 + P1) / P0 = (Div1 / P0) + (P1 - P0) / P0
