Customer Value = (Perceived Customer Benefits - Total Customer Cost)

**The main phases of the marketing process**

The marketing preocess is about creating value for customers to meet their needs. It includes three key phases :

* **Research** : Understanding the market, customers, and business environment
* **Planning** : Setting goals, analyzing factors, and developing a product plan
* **Implementation** : Executing the plan and tracking progress to reach goals

**Breakdown of the Three Phases of the Marketing Process**

* Research (Market Research) :

  1. Mission : Goals and Objectives

     * The first step is to identify and understand the mission, goals and objectives of your
       organization
       A mission statement is a short, clear explanation of why the organization exists and how
       it benefits consumers
       It's ideally customer-focused, not just about profit and dividends
       If your organization does not have a mission statement , sit down with marketing leaders and stakeholders to define
       your business's mission, goals and objectives
       You should also map out your goals and objectives
       As you're planning these elements, remember, your goals should follow the S-M-A-R-T criteria
  2. Situation Analysis

  * Using 5C's : Company, Customers, Competitors, Collaborators, Climate (Context)
    SWOT : Opportunities and Threats are external factors, Strenghts and Weaknesses are internal factors
* Plan (Strategy) :
  3. Marketing Strategy
  4. Marketing Mix (4 P)
* **Implementation (Operations) :**
  5. Implementation and Control

  **KPI :** Key Performance Indicators, What is going to be the Indicators of my success
  or my failure

Vague plans and poorly defined strategies can lead to confusion and misunderstandings

The importance of goals and objectives

Setting goals without measurable objectives will likely lead to goals that never get accomplished

Objectives without goals lack purpose/meaning

Goals can seem impossible or overwhelming unless broken into specific, measurable tasks
