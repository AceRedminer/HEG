# Welcome to Wonderland my little friends
### Here you can find everything my little self took the time and care to give to HEPIA

For any question don't hesitate to come and ask on wathever channel available such as :
- Mail

- In real life (my favorite option :), usually wearing polo's and a scarf around the neck btw)

### For any interest in playing chess contact me by mail so we can setup a match, always got my set on me and he's very cute uwu, even a little blitz in between the lectures!

### And if you speak spanish and want to learn italian i think we can make a deal hehe
